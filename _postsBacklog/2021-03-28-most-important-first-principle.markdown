This is going to be a short post since I will leave further in detail discussion on the specifics to the posts on the specific recommendations
To me this is an important life principal, but we will focus just on the development process.

1. [Ordering of words in a function/variable name.](/naming-conventions/)
2. [Ordering of declaration/calling of functions in a class definition.](/ordering-the-functions-in-your-class/)
3. Choosing the most important tickets to get done in a sprint.

Ok, you might have heard before you should prioritize your tasks and work on importance, there is nothing revolutionary about this.  But what I think is new is that ordering your code by importance can improve its readability.
