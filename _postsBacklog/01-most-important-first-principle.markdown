This is going to be a short post since I will leave further in detail discussion on the specifics to the posts on the specific recommendations
To me this is an important life principal, but I have also found it to be a good strategy for improving code readability.

I think this first started to dawn on me when a co-worker was asking me to prioritized

Given the choice to order thing

1. [Ordering of words in a function/variable name.](/naming-conventions/)
2. [Ordering of declaration/calling of functions in a class definition.](/ordering-the-functions-in-your-class/)
3. Choosing the most important tickets to get done in a sprint.

Ok, you might have heard before you should prioritize your tasks and work on importance, there is nothing revolutionary about this.  But what I think is new is that ordering your code by importance can improve its readability.
